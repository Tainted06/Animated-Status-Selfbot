# Animated-Status-Selfbot
A simple discord selfbot that animates your status

Put in your discord token, your status, and the wait time between changing the status 

## Warning:

Selfbots are against discord Terms Of Service
Use this at your own risk!
YOU CAN GET BANNED FROM DISCORD FOR USING THIS

Discord TOS: https://discord.com/terms

When you run this program, all your server folders will be deleted!
And your servers will be rearraged 
I'm not sure why this happens, possibly a bug in the api
